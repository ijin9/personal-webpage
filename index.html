                    <h2>LOUIS SANTOS</h2>
                    <P> I am John Louis Santos and you can call me Louis. I am a 3rd year college student from St. Bernadette College of Alabang, and my course is Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. <br>
                    <br>
                    I took this course because I wanted to, not because anyone told me to, including my family, friends, or anybody else. In fact, the fact that it is so logical makes it challenging. You must understand what you have done in the code and how to correct it in order to remedy the issue. Even though it's challenging and stressful, I still find enjoyment in it. Since I am a slow learner, I am picking things up gradually from what I have already learnt. <br>
                    <br>
                    Lastly, my interests. Running is my current pastime. My friends encouraged me to start jogging, which is great, and I truly enjoyed it. I run every day to stay healthy.
